        <h2>Cold Chain Handling</h2>
        <p>
          Peptides are sensitive to temperature. We ship with appropriate cold chain precautions to maintain product integrity. Upon receiving your order, we recommend storing peptides in the refrigerator (2-8°C) or freezer (-20°C) for long-term storage.
        </p>

We will work with the courier to resolve the issue and arrange a replacement if necessary.
